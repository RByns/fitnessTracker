# fitnessTracker

The idea behind this iOS swift 3 app is to make an activity tracker that the user could use in combination
with for example a diet tracker.
This would allow a user to log his / her workouts.
Further on a user can also add custom exercises and look up statistics.
These exercises are saved on the device of the user.
The app exists of a tab layout with mostly table views that contain the data.
